  # Computable Univariate Polynomials

  This file defines `CPolynomial R`, the type of canonical (trimmed) univariate polynomials.
  A polynomial is canonical if it has no trailing zeros, i.e., `p.trim = p`.

  This provides a unique representation for each polynomial, enabling stronger extensionality
  properties compared to the raw `CPolynomial.Raw` type.

/-- Computable univariate polynomials are represented canonically with no trailing zeros.

  A polynomial `p : CPolynomial.Raw R` is canonical if `p.trim = p`, meaning the last coefficient
  is non-zero (or the polynomial is empty). This provides a unique representative for each
  polynomial equivalence class.

  The result is canonical (no trailing zeros) when `c ≠ 0`.
  For example, `monomial 2 3` represents `3 * X^2`.

-- TODO: Ring equivalence between canonical polynomials and the quotient.
-- This establishes that `CPolynomial R` and `QuotientCPolynomial R` are isomorphic
-- as rings. The canonical polynomials serve as unique representatives of each
-- equivalence class in the quotient.
--
-- TODO: Construct this ring equivalence after proving:
-- 1. Operations on quotient correspond to operations on canonical representatives
-- 2. `trim` gives a unique representative for each equivalence class
--
-- The equivalence should map canonical polynomials to their quotient classes
-- and back, preserving all ring operations.
